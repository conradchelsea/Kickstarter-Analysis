# Kickstarting with Excel

## Collecting data in order to create successful Kickstarter campaigns. 

Creating charts to visualize how different kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Performed analysis on outcomes based on date of launch and fiscal goal.

The data proved that a successful campaign was likely to be launched in the Springtime (mid April to June) with a peak happening in May. 

The data proved the highest success rate was at 76% for 186 campaigns with a goal of $1000 or less. The second highest success rate was 73% for 534 campaigns at $1000-$5000, while the highest failure rate was 100% for 5 campaigns at $45,000 to $50,000. 

A challenge with this data is that while a 100% failure rate seems severe, there were only 5 campaigns involved. The majority of campaigns were successful. Unfortunately with charts showing the skewed data, it looks more like a gamble than it actually is. 

## Launching a campaign in May with a goal of $1000 will be the most successful. 

- Launching in the spring or summer is a good idea, despite it being when campaigning numbers are at their highest. Launching in December and January is a poor decision as they have the lowest success rates. 

- The highest volume and the most successful Kickstarters are launched with a goal of $1000 to $5000. Oddly, the failure and sucess rates teeter totter at opposite ends of the chart. When one is down, the other is up, almost in perfect balance. 

- We didn't have any information about the backers. We also didn't have any information into what the successful campaigns looked like, who were they targeting and how they engaged with their backers. 

- Bar graphs and pie charts are always great visual communicators because their solid shapes feel weighted and more impactful than a thin line moving through space.
